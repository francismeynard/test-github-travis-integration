# test-github-travis-integration

The project's objective is to integrate a java project in Github with Travis-CI to build and run test in every commit - Continuous Integration. The project used Gradle as the build tool and it works well with Travis.

### .travis.yml
<hr>
This is the most important file in the java project to make it travis aware.

### Code Coverage
<hr>
I used Code Climate with Travis CI for the code coverage.
